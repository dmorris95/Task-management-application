Welcome to the Task Management Application!

Github: https://github.com/dmorris95/Task-management-application

This is an HTML project using Bootstrap framwork to create a seamless series of webpages that showcase a task management application. From creating a task to editing the task and even including a user registration and login page.
This project also contains a zip file of the wireframes and prototypes I designed before building out the project in Visual Studio Code. The application contains an inline Nav Bar with links to all the pages so opening any of the HTML files allows access to the entire application.

  Dashboard - The dashboard showcases a card format of the current tasks for a specific user. Including buttons for deleting and editing the task. The edit button will take the user to the edit task form.
